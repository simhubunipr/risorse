Abstract 
Open Data are useful resources for science and healthcare, as can provide to anyone accessible and rapid information online as raw data. In the wake of the pandemic open data have made possible mapping, evaluating and monitoring infection at local and global level, but also an increase of standard and quality of data and a reduction of time needed to obtain data for further research. The harvest of academic literature available on main Health Sciences databases shows as results an increase since 2020 of submitted and published papers about open data correlated to infection risk.  Moreover, before and after 2020 published papers about open data in Health Sciences with reference to Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections are the least, or even completely absent according to different databases. Possible conclusions describe open data as an advantage for the health scientific community to track, study and adopt measures for Covid-19; while other forms of infections with similar impact in terms of burden for society and death tolls are “shadow” pandemics and not considered emergent global issues to be tackled by enforcing open policies on infection risk data such as in the case of Covid-19 pandemic. Further research should be provided interviewing experts, healthcare providers and institutions about the splitted attitude to openness of health data given similar global contexts of application in infection risk prevention, monitoring and control.
Key words: AMR, Covid-19, HAIs, infection risk, open data

1. INTRODUCTION
In the past two years, the attention of the scientific research focused on Covid-19 pandemic and brought evidence that the availability of open information about the trend of contagion was useful to the individuation of proper solutions to tackle the evolution of the pandemia. An open data strategy has been adopted almost since the beginning of the world spread of the pandemic (1) avoiding time and permission barriers among healthcare institutions, research centres and governments, all partners at once in the challenge against Covid-19. Such data is published on the web, therefore users don’t need to formalise requests to obtain access to such data and permission to reuse. Researchers could access data related to the infection (2). 
However, as COVID-19 has raged on, the pandemic of healthcare associated infections (HAIs) and of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues in the shadows (3). HAIs are considered one of the most common adverse events in health care service provision. In order to contain AMR phenomena and prevent the occurrence of HAIs, it should be important to implement several prevention strategies. Scientific research has not found solutions to stop the HAIs and AMR as effective as those identified to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. 
We hypothesise that this difference might find an explanation in the unavailability for researchers of open data related to HAIs and AMR. In this systematic review of the literature we intend to verify the extent to which research on HAIs and AMR used open data before and during the pandemic. In a second step we compare the results with Covid-10 results only for the last two years (2020-2021).
The aim of the research is to evaluate the amount of scientific publications that use or cite open data relating to human infections before the covid-19 pandemic and after the onset of the pandemic. The number and contents of scientific publications mentioning “open data” should allow us to evaluate to what extent the COVID issue has led research based on open data in the biomedical fields during the pandemic and to what extent it has made evident the importance of open data for the management of infections compared to other global issues.
2. BACKGROUND
The importance of availability of data in Public Health Emergencies and the need of  sharing data had been brought to attention during Ebola e Zika outbreaks (4; 5; 6). Further studies confirmed that the availability of accurate and robust epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data early in an epidemic are important to understand risk factors for infection, to guide public health decision-making (7; 8) and to provide the baseline for reducing the burden of disease.

2.1. The global burden of Covid-19

In just over two years, 450 million cases of Covid-19 with more than 6 million deaths in the world have been reported to WHO (9). Since the beginning, some researchers developed an online interactive dashboard, hosted by the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, to visualise and track reported cases of COVID-19 in real time (10). Data relating to the pandemic began to be entered in open access mode in the USA (11) and in other countries (12; 13), while the publishers began to publish several papers using that data (2; 14). In Italy, after the first cases were diagnosed, the Department of Civil Protection had begun to make publicly available daily some summary reports about the number of infected people, the deaths and the healed. All data was provided strictly in the form of PDF files. On March 4th, OnData, an association that promotes the opening of public data to make it accessible to all, took the initiative to make available to all the daily data relating to the evolution of the epidemic in "machine readable" format. Three days later, the Italian Department of Civil Protection released on a public repository open data about Covid-19. 
As COVID-19 has raged on, the pandemic of HAIs and the pandemic of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (3) continue both in the shadows.
2.2. The global burden of HAIs
Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs),  which occur when a patient is receiving care in a hospital or other healthcare facility (15; 16; 17) still represent a major Public Health problem because of a high prevalence rate of 4% in USA (18), 5,7% in the EU (19) and 7,1% in Italy (20), In Europe, as estimated, approximately 2,7 million patients suffer every year from HAI (21). According to last statistical evaluations, HAIs cause more deaths worldwide than malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS combined (22). In the case of U.S.A., HAIs contribute to patient mortality with an estimated 1.7 million infections and 99,000 deaths each year (23) HAIs are also playing their part for the significant increase for healthcare costs (24;25). The total annual global cost for five of the most common types of HAI is estimated at $8.3–$11.5 billion (26). Despite their ubiquity, still much is unknown about how to prevent HAI, and no single hospital or healthcare facility in the world can claim to be unaffected from such a burden. Furthermore, according to the data published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the incidence of HAI caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms is increasing (27).
2.3. The global burden of AMR
Even before penicillin was introduced, resistant strains of bacteria had been detected (28). Given the environmental impact of drug abuse and misuse, bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as one of the leading public health threats of the 21st Century. A recent study estimated 4·95 million deaths associated with bacterial AMR happened globally in 2019, and  a median of 1·27 million deaths in 2019 directly attributable to resistance (29). This value  is nearly the same as global HIV deaths (680 000) (30) and malaria deaths (627 000) (31) combined, and ranks behind only COVID-19 and tuberculosis in terms of global deaths from an infection. WHO and numerous other groups and researchers agree that the spread of AMR is an urgent issue requiring a global, coordinated action plan to address. (32; 33; 34). Clear information on the health and economic burden of antibiotic resistance is urgently needed to make this complex problem tangible to policy makers (35). 
In the last years some important progresses have been made in terms of surveillance and prevention of AMR and in making of new antibiotics, but these progresses have not been sufficient to reduce significantly the burden (36). There are still serious data gaps in many low-income settings, emphasising the need to expand data collection systems and improve our understanding of this important human health threat. (3).

2.4 The advantage of open data for science

The idea that science should be accessible to all, advocated by Merton in the 1970s (37), has given lymph to The Open Science movement which was enabled by the rise of online and open access journals in the 1990s (38). Supporters of the Open Science ethos went a step further by promoting more general access not only to the final research results, but also to the underlying data that inform and support these (39). Open Data has been defined as "structured data that is machine-readable, freely shared, used and built on without restrictions." (40, 41). In the last years, the idea of Open Data has been inserted and implemented within the conceptual framework of the FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, making data freely available online and in a format that allows re-use for multiple purposes (42). In the five-stars model (43,44), open data should fulfil at least requirements for the first three stars: an open licence, and a structured, open and non-proprietary file format.
What are the main advantages of using open data in science, and particularly for infection risk research?
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that  there are at least two reasons for open data adoption by the scientific community: a) enhance experimental reproducibility, which is the minimal standard for research validity (same data, same analysis code, same results); b) accelerating solutions discoveries (let’s think of the vaccines development) and knowledge delivery (45). Therefore, it is essential to not only publish papers, but to also release the underlying data: data should be “first class citizens” and the formats they are represented and stored in should never be a static one such as pdf, for instance. 
Since the beginning of COVID-19, or at least when the scientific community realized that a more efficient way to conduct and disseminate research was needed very fast,  adoption of open data practices was required by research centres and journals. This has shown that an alternative way is possible, an ecosystem in which research is disseminated fast via preprints, and data sharing and publication becomes the norm. 
2.5 Open Data and pandemic research 

In the case of Covid-19 pandemic the institutions have understood since the beginning the importance of supplying daily data about the evolution of the spread, but also to make them openly available for reuse by scientists. According to the literature, what made the difference was the availability of open data and the fast research publishing, making it possible to discover drugs to counter the severity of the disease, to identify and implement infection prevention strategies and above all to implement effective vaccines in a very short time. In the case of HAIs and AMR, results show an increase through the years but a weak one incomparable with the one related to Covid-19.
These three major Public Health problems have received much attention from the scientific literature, but the positive results that have been obtained for Covid-19 in terms of prevention and treatment have not been obtained for HAIs and AMR. The literature has given great importance to the open data strategy in allowing the positive results obtained in the management of Covid-19 (46, 2, 47, 48, 49). On the basis of this statement we hypothesize that the researchers who have dealt with HAIs and AMR have not had the opportunity to use open data. To provide an initial contribution to the verification of this hypothesis, we conducted an analysis of the scientific literature to verify how many scientific articles on HAI and AMR used open data before the pandemic and if after the usefulness of the open data strategy was demonstrated by the covid there has been an increase in the use of the open data strategy for HAI and AMR.

3. MATERIAL AND METHODS
The analysis of the literature covered the period 2012 - 2021 divided in four different search timespan: 2012-2021, 2012-2017, 2018-2019 and 2020-2021.
The decision to conduct 4 different searches with different time range was taken in order to understand different aspects about open data adoption curve and growth in literature and therefore research. Ten years backwards was considered accountable to go back to the spread of open data in the scientific communities. Covid-19 Mesh and key word search was used only for the last two years 2020-2021 considered.
The analysis of the literature was designed and conducted harvesting four search engines able to represent scientific production in the biomedicine and healthcare sciences: Pubmed, Cinahl, Google scholar, and Scopus.
PubMed is the well-known reference citational database of the sector. In the case of Pubmed, we have examined the search terms for open data in the mesh. That was a needed step to build the search string to quantify the number of scientific publications using or citing open data. Although Cinahl is a tool primarily designed for the training, research and updating of nurses (with practical purposes) and not for the dissemination of biomedical research results, the results of a research in Cinahl are complementary to those found by querying PubMed. Coming to Scopus, its main goal is to map the authors of the publications and their affiliations, not so much the bibliographic universe of biomedical publications; the bibliographic coverage of Scopus is therefore not necessarily the most complete compared to the existing one; moreover, Scopus does not use the MESH vocabulary, nor does it have an internal vocabulary of controlled search tags / terms, therefore the information retrieval may present inaccuracies in the results. Last, but not least, we have included Google Scholar. Although it is not a database, but a search engine freely accessible on the web, we have chosen to use Google Scholar because it indexes the complete text or metadata of academic literature also available in repositories not indexed by PubMed. The Google Scholar index includes peer-reviewed online academic journals and books, conference papers, theses and dissertations, preprints, abstracts, technical reports and other academic literature, including court opinions and patents. As part of this research, the use of GS is well suited for two purposes:
check for any non-indexed contributions in PubMed;
allow you to evaluate how much the topic / topics under investigation are widespread in the published and unpublished academic literature.
In Google scholar it is possible to use the simple search by keyword or expression through the use of Boolean operators or the advanced search that allows you to combine a string (exact phrase) with terms (all words) with the possibility of limiting the search to title field of the article (but not in the abstract) and set a certain time range.
Limits and criticalities of the tool are:
the sources indexed by Google Scholar are not known;
the secrecy of the ranking algorithm;
the ranking of the results is, in a certain sense, personalised as it is influenced by factors, such as previous searches, the choices and selections already made and the geolocalization of whom launches the query (proof of this is the diversity of the results of the same research done by different people in different places);
poverty of the filters applicable to the search compared to the tools for refinement of the results available in the databases.
The starting hypothesis of the research was that the use of open data in biomedical publications relating to hospital infections was minimal before Covid and that, even after the emergence of the pandemic and the consequent and internationally widespread movement of information sharing, the use of open data is still almost exclusively limited to data relating to sars cov 2 infections. The availability of open data relating to healthcare-related infections has always been and still is residual, although it is now scientifically proven that use of open data for infection management is vital.
Starting from the MeSH interrogation and, in an immediately following phase, from the examination of the literature identified through the first interrogations in PubMed, some search terms were identified, corresponding to the main focus of the review.
Given the absence of a controlled vocabulary of search terms (thesaurus) shared by the bibliographic tools identified, specific search strings were then identified for each database / repository.
The databases and repositories identified were queried with queries based on these search terms, in particular:
open data and equivalents such as dataset, or database
infection risk and equivalents
open data and equivalents + infection risk and equivalents
COVID-19 and equivalents + open data and equivalents
risks associated with hospital and equivalent infections
risks associated with hospital infections and equivalents + open data and equivalents
AMR and equivalents
AMR and equivalents + open data and equivalents
The research on Pubmed was conducted on March 31st, on Scopus and Cinahl on April 7th, and on Google Scholar on May 2nd. All data are available on ZENODO by the link at the bottom of the article.

4. Results/findings
To understand how open data and infection risk from pandemic size are combined in literature according to different time ranges, four different ranges of time were considered: some years before pandemic, the outbreak in 2020, and a post-pandemic period of 2021 until March 2022,  until two years since the outbreak. 
In second place, to understand and compare if Covid-19 has been driving and increasing research by and on open data in health sciences, queries to include and exclude Covid-19 were made to the databases, and queries about other two global threats AMR and HAIs were researched.
In order to tackle such research the following steps have been taken.
Four main databases available to harvest health sciences publications related to infection risk topic were considered eligible: PubMed, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and Scopus. Grey literature and other databases were excluded from the research.
A preemptive research on MeSh catalog in PubMed have made possible to refine the search choosing the most common and adopted terms. Only information about citations in title and abstract have been searched by queries. Between March and May 2022 we ran some data comparison with these 4 different queries organised and set up according to search strategies peculiar for each database.

– Infection risk and open data
Since the introduction of e-Science, or Science 2.0 and OAI (Open Access Initiative) to share papers, preprints, and databases by the world wide web, big data, big and open data (B&OD) and open data have been a growing trend, however we want to name it, as practice among certain epistemic communities, especially when copyright and patenting hasn't been an issue. Health Sciences deal with data that include often privacy concerns that make datasets not available for the public, while the web makes possible to share in real time data about results, but also about monitoring phenomena. To understand if and how open data have emerged in health sciences literature about infection risk al large, queries about infection risk and open data were considered through a range of 10 years (2012-2022). Alternative keywords such as “infection”, “data sharing” and “dataset” were used. A research with same key words has been conducted only for the two years related to Covid-19 pandemic to understand if during the same time open data have been included as term and  for infection risk at large.

Covid-19 and open data
In this case the harvest of literature on the main databases has been framed only for the two years of the pandemic (March 2020 - March 2022). Although Covid-19 represents a form of infection risk the comparison among parallel queries about the first and the latter may bring much light on the ontologies and the possible relation between them.
AMR and open data
In the case of antimicrobial resistance, the term itself has been combined with open data and data sharing to harvest the databases in order to probe any presence of the two terms



HAIs and open data
Choosing the right term for the query about healthcare-associated infections has undergone the the analysis of Mesh terms. 5 different key words were used: cross infection, nosocomial infection, health care-associated infections, Hospital Acquired Infections in order to harvest any possible way to name the HAIs in the literature on databases.




5. Discussion
Our bibliometric analysis has documented that the number of publications containing the equivalent open data terms and covid-19 in 2020 and, above all, in 2021 is very high. During the pandemic, researchers from around the world collated and curated valuable open data sources (50; 51). Real-time development of statistical analysis and rapid reports have provided crucial early analysis of virus evolution, transmission and severity (52; 53; 54).
The number of scientific publications concerning infection risk also increases progressively in the observation period and shows a peak in the last two years, doubling the number of the previous two years. It is easy to hypothesise that this last strong increase is also to be attributed to covid-19. The risk of SarsCov 2 infection and the effectiveness of the prevention and containment measures of covid-19 have in fact concentrated the attention of biomedical research in recent years. are concerned with infection risk, however, it does not seem to have been influenced that much by the outbreak of the pandemic. It is indeed true that the number of publications containing the equivalent terms open data and infection risk in the two-year period 2020-2021 has almost doubled compared to the previous two-year period, but it is just 28 publications in 20/21 and 15 in 18/19 compared to 46,000 publications dealing with infection risk during the period. The same goes for healthcare-related infections. The use of the term health care associated infection and equivalents in the title and abstracts of scientific articles is frequent, there are over 12,000 articles identified, confirming that the problem is considered very serious by the scientific world, are among the major complications of modern medical therapy (55). The publications increased progressively in the decade under review with a peak in the last two years and an increase of over 40% in the last two years compared to the previous one. Also in this case it is easy to hypothesise that the basis of this increase is the Covid-19 pandemic.
In fact, the exponential increase in claims caused by healthcare-associated infections related to COVID-19 (56) and it is known that the number of doctors who are COVID-19 positive is increasing exponentially worldwide. 
When we associated the term cross infection and equivalents with open data and equivalents, we observed that the number of publications in the last two years of observation has more than doubled compared to the previous two years, but it is just 37 and 17 publications in the two periods compared to over 6000 articles covering health care-related infections in the same period. Although sharing research, evidence and best practice is considered important for the prevention of this serious problem (57).
As for the other pandemic problem that has plagued the world for many years, that of the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics, the search for the term antibiotic resistance…


6. Conclusions
In the last two years in which the analysis was conducted, the number of these publications has increased by more than 60%. These two years are the years in which Mankind has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and the pandemic has changed the relationship between scientific research and open data (58; 59; 60)
The research has given strong evidence that open data and the global threat  represented by Covid-19/pandemic are strongly correlated in PubMed. Such correlation is also documented by a growing curve in the past years about infection risk and open data, that increased with the event pandemic. Although, before 2020 no publication including the former two terms be available, since the spread of the pandemic, rates are highest compared to past 8 years. When it comes to the two other forms of global threats results from research are weak or even absent. In the case of other databases researches are not representatives for different reasons: kind of databases, uncommon terms of research, heterogeneity of elements harvested, as in the case of Google Scholar. According to the findings from the research in the literature in 4 databases should represent the curve of adoption of open data in infection risk research. Given its extraordinary status of pandemic Covid-19 open data have been adopted since the beginning of the spread, as confirmed by the literature. In the case of HAI.
In the case of AMR although being a growing trend….
Further research might address how different forms of infection risks according to their status of pandemic or silent pandemic deserve open data policies, or not. It should also be provided interviewing experts, healthcare providers and institutions about the splitted attitude to openness of health data given similar global contexts of application in infection risk prevention, monitoring and control.
Open data are adopted in pandemic conditions for reasons not related to numbers and not because of the risk level of infection, but for conditions and factors that might require further research and proper awareness within the scientific community.
Probably the adoption of open data for other menacies such as HAI and AMR, would create successful conditions and boost social and political factors for further adoption in other fields.
On the basis of this statement we hypothesise that the researchers who have dealt with HAIs and AMR have not had the opportunity to use open data.
